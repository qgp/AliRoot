Run simulations for MUON+MFT track merging tests
------------------------------------------------

After AliRoot installation, copy the file 

ITSMFT/MFT/data/PionKaonKinematics.root 

to the location $ALICE_ROOT/ITSMFT/MFT/data

To run a simulation with <n_events>, 10 JPsi per event decay in two muons 
and <n_mult> pi/K in the MFT acceptance:

. runMFT.sh <n_mult> <n_events> 1

<n_mult> can go up to 3000

The output file MFT.Tracks.root contains:

- a tree Events with the vertex position per event
- a tree MFTCells with all cells building the standalone MFT tracks
- a tree MFTTracks with the standalone MFT tracks
- a tree MUONTracks with tracks of type AliMUONTrack which have been 
  prolongated with the clusters of the MFT standalone tracks
