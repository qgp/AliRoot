### Framework maintained by Johannes Stiller ###
# FT2 prepared by Ruben Shahoyan and Johannes Stiller with support from Marian Ivanov
# This code is still under development and despite tests, it may not work out of the box
# Please report success and problems to jstiller@cern.ch

# FT2 Status: 
# 18/11/2015: 	Currently FT2 is tuned and parameterized on LHC13d19
		No TPC or TOF PID available yet
		FT2 is capable of handling primary particles and extended to work for conversion in material (to be full tested)
		For experts - current working configuration: ITS (2.0,2.0), dNdY = 5100
		To do: AOD on/off setter, fully propagated - naming convention of files should not be jstiller_’…’ (please keep as is for now)
# 17/12/2015:   Current FT2 setup: ITS (2.2,2.2), dNdy = 1; close to no dependence of primary particles to fake cluster BUT strange weak decays strongly depend on them especially at high pT. Best performance with no fake cluster.
		In case HIJING generation and decays are used, be careful: strange weak decays in HIJING and GEANT do not agree; however, GEANT algorithm (without any material interaction) still much slower because of propagation times
		For this reason fastGen.C should not be used as default; In case you want to use it, re-enable the lines which are marked as ‚// un-comment if running with fastGen‘
		FT2 now usable in standalone mode WITHOUT the bugs found in LHC13d19. If you want to use that, set ‚standaloneTune=kTRUE’ in the run_mcgenFT2.C script. Other FT2 features are still tuned on LHC13d19 though (i.e. ITS-TPC matching)
# 18/12/2015:   The binary files which contain the FT2 TF1 and AliNDLocalRegression parameterizations for LHC13d19 are available on the GRID: /alice/cern.ch/user/j/jstiller/FT2_LHC13d19_parameterizations/

# FT2 GRID Operation instruction
# For running a standalone FT2 simulation on the GRID, you need the files in your GRID directory as listed below
# All files can be found in the same directory as these instructions
# full log is written and copied to output directory ‚simRecAod.log‘
# many files carry the name jstiller_’…’. Please don’t change that for now

### JDL
- Please adjust paths to your own directory
Requires five input variables:
1) run number (from LHC10h)
2) events per job (‚100‘ is a good, stable choice; ‚200‘ is having memory problems in ~ 30 % of the cases without resubmissions)
3) monitor file (use ‚1‘ as default)
4) first job id (use ‚1‘ as default) 
5) number of jobs / last job id

### aliroot_fastMC
simrun.sh and ESD check started from here

### simrun.sh
simulation, reconstruction, AOD filtering and other tasks started from here
on the fly analysis can be inserted here

### run_mcgenFT2.C
steering macro of parameterized fast simulation
if you don’t need the AOD filtering, insert a return statement at correct position
several steering setters available, i.e. turn on/off conversion, decay, material absorption 
vector of default setters is given, please only change when you know what you are doing

### sim.C
Simulation setup

### Config.C 
Generation setup of sqrt{s}=5.5 TeV, 0-10% central HIJING collisions

### fastGen.C -> decapricated
simplified setup of MC simulation
to large extend similar to LHC13d19

### AliAnalysisTaskSEFT2Simulation.h AliAnalysisTaskSEFT2Simulation.cxx AddTaskFT2Simulation.C
Steering of FT2 simulation and creation of ESD tracks + primary vertex reconstruction

### FT2.cxx FT2.h
FT2 class; copy it from aliroot source directory for most recent version (‚ITS/UPGRADE/FT2’)
grid nodes don’t see source directories, copy it manually in your GRID directory

### FT2 support files can be found on the GRID (LHC13d19), or contact Johannes for details / help
/alice/cern.ch/user/j/jstiller/smearedMCtest/LHC13d19_fastMc 
ft2_parameterization_LHC13d19.root
h-p_CrossSections.root
geometry.root
itsSegmentations.root
the latter two are only needed, if your sim.C/fastGen.C does not produce them

### CheckSmearedESD.C
very loose check of track reconstruction efficiency

### MakeAODInputChain.C ConfigVertexingHF.C
grid nodes don’t see source directories, copy it manually in your GRID directory
current ConfigVertexingHF.C reduced to handle vertices of 2 prongs only for speed reasons

### validation. sh
checking if ESD and AOD are generated and files physically exist
