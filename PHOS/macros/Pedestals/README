1. Take a run of type PEDESTAL with data recording

2. Analyze raw data from pedestal run by macro Pedestals.C:
   .L Pedestals.C+
   Pedestals("path-to-raw-file.root")
   File ped<run_number>.root will be created.

3. Process the root file produced at step 2 by runPedestal.C:
   root -b -l -q runPedestal.C'(run_number)'
   it will produce PedestalTable_<run_number>.tgz with text files in format for
   loading to ALTRO memory VFPED

4. un-pack tar file:
   tar zxf PedestalTable_<run_number>.tgz
