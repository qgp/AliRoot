This directory contains a set of scripts related to PHOS alignment.
Method used in 2015:
1) using minuit minimization find PHOS alignment matrixes which produce correct position of repers in ALICE.
   This is done with CheckPHOSAlignment.C macros.
2) with macros MakeFinalAlignment.C one first creates ideal PHOS rotation matrixes, 
   then calculates correct rotation matrixes and finally calculates offses. Rotation matrixes 
   created in reconstruction and stored in ESD file can be ptinted with PrintPHOSMatrix.C macros.







The PHOS alignment object (AliPHOSAlignData) contans as data members 3
parameters:
   number of modules
   center position of each module in MARS
   module orientation in MARS

The script AliPHOSSetAlignment.C allows to set PHOS align object for
two cases:
   1) PHOS geometry for the first LHC run 2007, one module with ideal
      position;
   2) Full PHOS geometry with all 5 modules randomly displaced.
The align object is being written to CBD to the local directory
InitAlignDB/PHOS/Alignment/Geometry for the case 1 and directory 
DisAlignDB/PHOS/Alignment/Geometry for the case 2.
This script uses a menu (TControlBar) to set and read the align
object.

The script AliPHOSDisalign.C runs simulations described in Config.C
(100 electrons towards the PHOS apperture, all detectors but PHOS are
switched off). Before running simulations, the PHOS align object is
read from the CDB. The first argument of the function AliPHOSDisalign
sets the upper level directory name containing the CBD object.

When the disaligned PHOS geometry was created, one has to check it for
oberlaps:
  gGeoManager->CheckOverlaps(0.1);
  gGeoManager->PrintOverlaps();
