Photos C++ Interface
--------------------
Web page  http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ndavidson/photos/doxygen/

Documentation is in documentation/latex_documentation, type "make" there

To compile the interface:
- Execute "./configure" (if the path to HepMC is not set with
                        HEPMCLOCATION, use "./configure --with-hepmc=<path>"
                        or use "./configure --without-hepmc")
- Execute "make"

--------------------------------------
  Alternatively cofiguration scripts based on autotools can be used.
  In this case 'cd platform', './use-LCG-config.sh' and             
  follow the instructions in the freshly created './INSTALL' readme file.
  The configure file in the directory 'examples' will be absent.         
  The instructions collected below should be then ignored.               
  Under MAC OS one may need to remove '-lfreetype' from                  
  'examples/Makefile'                                                    
-------------------------------------- 

To run the examples, "cd examples". There "./configure" and "make" as well.
For some of the examples to work, pythia8.1 and MC-Tester will be needed.
The most basic example does not need them.

NOTE:
On CERN platforms (lxplus, lxplus4, lxplus5...) the software located 
in the /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/ directory can be used. For that purpose execute:

source platform/afs.paths.sh (or source platform/afs.paths.csh)

prior to  "./configure" executed without any parameters. The same paths will
be used by examples there;  "./configure" in the examples direcotry after
compiling the interface as well. 

Paths defined in platform/afs.paths.sh:

export HEPMCLOCATION=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/HepMC/2.03.11/slc4_amd64_gcc34
export PYTHIALOCATION=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/pythia8/135/slc4_amd64_gcc34
export TAUOLALOCATION=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/tauola++/1.0.2a/slc4_amd64_gcc34
export MCTESTERLOCATION=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/mctester/1.24/slc4_amd64_gcc34

export PATH=/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.22.00/slc4_amd64_gcc34/root/bin:$PATH

can be modified.
