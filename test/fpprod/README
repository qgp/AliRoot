Productions for the first physics studies (25/04/2008, updated 13/07/2009):
Each run contains 300000 events, 200000 for calculation of the correction maps, 100000 used as "real" data

Configurations:
-------------
10 TeV:
- field 0T
  - Pythia: min. bias ATLAS tuning.
  - Phojet: default parameters fo min. bias simulation.
- field 0.5T
  - Pythia
  - Phojet

900 GeV:
- field 0T
  - Pythia: min. bias ATLAS tuning
  - Phojet
- field 0.5T
  - Pythia
  - Pjojet

Beam parameters:
- energy: 900 GeV, 10 TeV
- beta* 10m

Field:
- new measured field

Detectors:
- ITS: v11Hybrid
- TPC
- TRD: modules 0,(1),(7),8,9,(16),17 (around 3h and 9h). 
       Enumerated from X in positive direction.
       The modules in brackets are added in 2009.
- TOF: full
- HMPID
- PHOS: all modules, the missing ones to be treated in the analysis
- EMCAL: no EMCAL in 2008, full EMCAL in 2009. The missing modules will be
         switched off in the analysis 
- MUON
- T0
- VZERO
- FMD
- PMD: 6 out of 26 modules -> switch off in the first run 2008. In 2009 - full PMD
- ZDC: set the beam energy in AliMagF
- ACORDE: off

Simulation/reconstruction
-------------------------

Mis-alignment:
- full misalignment in the simulation, ideal in  the reconstruction

Mis-calibration:
- full or residual: they are very similar, however do as above.

What do we produce in the reconstruction?
- ESD
- ESD friends
- AODs from the analysis train

Which files do we keep?
- galice.root
- geometry.root
- Kinematics.root
- TrackReferences.root
- Rec. points for visualization
- AliESDs.root
- AliESDfriends.root
- tags
- RAW data
