//
// base class for AOD particles
//
// Most of the methods defined in this base class (or even all of them)
// should be redefined in derived classes. Some methods like Pt() or
// Vx() have default implementation, but they are not optimised for
// performance. It is likely that they can be (and should be) implemented
// in the derived classes in a way which gives faster access.
//
// Algorithms and analysis classes should as much as possible use the
// interface of the base class instead of special methods of derived
// classes. This allows to run the code on all types of particles.
