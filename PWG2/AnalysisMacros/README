The AnalysisMacros is divided into six sub-directories:

o) Local
   Inside this directory you can find the files you need to run the following processes:
    i)  (Sub-dir Tags)Creation tag files for the locally stored ESDs - The two files are stored under the Tags directory. Run it by typing "root runTagCreator.C". One should pay attention that the CreateTags.C macro needs to be modified in the line where you call the ReadLocalCollection function of the tag creator object.
    ii) Analysis of the locally stored ESDs using the previously created tag files - Run the example by typing "root runLocal.C"

o) Interactive
   You can find the runInteractive.C file that uses the root api to access the grid as well as a collection of tag files to be querried (tag.xml). You should also use the AliAnalysisTaskPt.* from the Local directory. Run the example by typing "alienroot runInteractive.C" (you can find the alienroot executable in this directory - open it and change it accordingly - place it in a directory which is defined in your $PATH).

o) Batch
   You can find the executable (that you should store under your $HOME/bin  AliEn directory), the jdl file (you must change it accordingly), as well as the macro runBatch.C. You should also use the AliAnalysisTaskPt.* from the Local directory and the global.xml file (information on how to create this file can be found in the tutorial slides - CreateXML function). Everybody who wants to use these files should change them accordingly!!!

o) Proof
   You can find the runProof.C macro to be used for CAF. The CreateESDChain.C & the txt file containing the ESDs' location in the cluster can be found in the CAF web page.

o) Kine
   You can find the runKine.C along with the AliAnalysisTaskPtMC class. Use the example to access the MC information. You have to run it with root. If you follow the instructions indicated in the Local - Interactive - Batch - Proof directories you will be able to access the MC information on all kinds of sessions.
