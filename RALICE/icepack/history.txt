01-dec-2004 NvE First release of the package as a subdirectory of Ralice.
18-feb-2005 NvE Copyright format modified in all .cxx source files in line with Ralice
                such that the text shows up correctly in the auto-generated html docs.
13-apr-2005 NvE Documentation of IceEvent updated w.r.t. the labeling of MC and Reco tracks.
21-apr-2005 NvE Directory iceconvert introduced to hold the various readers to
                convert Amanda/IceCube data into the Ralice/IcePack event structures.
12-aug-2005 NvE TTask derived class IceXtalk introduced for cross talk correction.
20-sep-2005 NvE TTask derived class IceCalibrate introduced for (de)calibration of data.
                Also example macros icextalk.cc and icecalib.cc introduced in the /macros
                directory to illustrate the usage of these TTask based procedures.
07-oct-2005 NvE Typo fixed in memberfunction SetCalibFile of IceXtalk and IceCalibrate.
13-oct-2005 NvE TTask derived class IceCleanHits introduced to perform hit cleaning.
                Also example macro icecalib.cc in the /macros directory updated to
                illustrate the use of the hit cleaning processor. 
20-oct-2005 NvE Trigger time window selection introduced in IceCleanHits based
                on Dipo's trigger time distributions. For further details see the
                docs of IceCleanHits.
31-oct-2005 NvE Slight correction in IceCalibrate.cxx and IceCleanhits.cxx to satisfy
                the gcc compiler (thanks Dipo).
                Also first (prototype) version of class IceDwalk introduced to perform
                direct walk reconstruction. In the /macros directory an example job
                icedwalk.cc has been introduced.
03-nov-2005 NvE User selectable trigger time setting introduced in IceCleanhits to allow
                investigation of various trigger time settings.
                Protection introduced in IceDwalk for the case that no track candidates
                are left.
                Also protection introduced in IceXtalk for the case that no OM database
                was specified. 
14-nov-2005 NvE Only devices derived from IceGOM taken into account in IceCalibrate
                and only devices derived from IceAOM taken into account in IceXtalk 
                to comply with the presence of the newly introduced Trigger device.
                IceCleanHits updated to support automatic trigger time setting from
                the IceEvent trigger information.
14-nov-2005 NvE Typo corrected in IceCleanHits::SetTnameA.
17-nov-2005 NvE Prototype version of IceDwalk tuned/improved for multi-track reconstruction. 
15-feb-2006 NvE Class IcePandel introduced. In the /macros directory an example job
                icepandel.cc was introduced as well.
23-feb-2006 NvE All global slotnames and signals copied from OM Dbase info (if present)
                in IceCalibrate. This will provide all necessary calib. info in case
                the original F2K file didn't contain these data.
                Also anaroot.cc example macro introduced in /macros sub-directory.
                This example macro shows how to analyse the IcePack event structures
                from a chain of ROOT files using the task processor facilities.
28-feb-2006 NvE Example macro anaroot.cc in sub-directory /macros updated to use the
                more convenient new ProcessObject() facility of AliJob.
                Also unused variables r, rmin and rmax removed in IcePandel.cxx to prevent
                compiler warnings. 
07-mar-2006 NvE Facility introduced in IceDwalk and IcePandel to modify the name tag of
                the produced tracks via the memberfunction SetTrackName().
                Also specification of maximum number of good fired modules for events to
                be processed introduced in IceDwalk. 
10-mar-2006 NvE Xtalk ADC correction value stored as ADC offset in IceXtalk processing.
                This will allow easy investigation of Xtalk corrected hits and also
                enable successive Xtalk processing to investigate (systematic) effects
                of various criteria. See the IceXtalk docs for further details.
                Also specification of minimum number of good fired modules for events to
                be processed introduced in IceDwalk. 
                New class IceLinefit introduced.  
14-mar-2006 NvE User defined track charge setting introduced in IceDwalk, IceLinefit and IcePandel.
29-mar-2006 NvE Modified numerical evaluation of pandel value in IcePandel to extend validity
                range (by George and Dipo).
                Also new memberfunction SetPenalty() introduced in IcePandel.
