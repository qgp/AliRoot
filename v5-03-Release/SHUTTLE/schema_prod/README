This directory contians LDAP schema for Shuttle configuration.

shuttle.schema - schmea definition. All detectors entries have the
objectClass defined in shuttle.schema (shuttleConfig).

TPC.ldif, ITS.ldif PHOS.ldif - contains examples for detector configuration.

AliShuttleConfig uses ROOT ldap package to access the ldap server.
Following manual interventions are needed for ROOT LDAP package:

1) ROOT LDAP package uses deprecated functions as: ldap_simple_bind_s etc.
To compile ROOT with LDAP support properly, LDAP_DEPRECATED has to be defined.


2) As all contemporary LDAP servers use LDAP V3 protocol and the dafault
protocol is LDAP V2 some lines have to be added to file TLDAPServer.cxx

in method: Int_t TLDAPServer::Bind()

add before ldap_simple_bind_s

 Int_t protVersion = 3;
 if((result = ldap_set_option(fLd, LDAP_OPT_PROTOCOL_VERSION, &protVersion)
                        != LDAP_OPT_SUCCESS )) {
                Error("Bind", "Could not set protocol version 3!");
                return result;
 }
