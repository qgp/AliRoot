To compile make shure to set the ROOTSYS variable
to point to your ROOT installation.

then type "make".
the executable "pftest" is intended to test and debug the
Peakfinder algorithm. It also serves as an example of how to use
the algorithm.

PEAKFINDER HOW TO
The Peakfinder vectors are found in the folder "PFVectors".
The folder contains  peafinder solution vectors for the most likely
set of parameters. If a file does not exist for a given set of parameters
then the PF vector must be supplied by the user.
the file format is asci text and the name of the file identifies the content.
The file name is on the format

[startindex][number of samples][risetime][samplingrate in MHz].txt

startindex:
a startindex N means that the first sample of the subarray used for the 
reconstruction must correspond to a timedelay t0 in the
range (N, N+1) sample intervals.

N:
the number of samples of the sub array.

tau: 
Risetime in micro seconds

fs:
Sample rate in MHz
