/*Basic Memory Leak utility.
    
    You can use this tiny class to *see* if your program is leaking.
    Usage:
    AliMemoryWatcher memwatcher;
    some program loop on events here {
      if ( nevents % x == 0 ) 
      {
      // take a sample every x events
        memwatcher.watch(nevents);
      }
    }
    TFile f("out.root","RECREATE");
    memwatcher.write();
    f.Close();
    In the output root file you'll get 3 graphs representing
    the evolAliPHOSon, as a function of the number of events, of :
    - VSIZE is the virtual size (in KBytes) of your program, that is sort of
    the total memory used
    - RSSIZE is the resident size (in KBytes), that is, the part of your 
    program which is really in physical memory.
    - TIME is an estimate of time per event (really it's the time elasped
    between two calls to watch method)
    WARNING: this is far from a bulletproof memory report (it's basically 
    using UNIX command ps -h -p [PID] -o vsize,rssize to do its job).
    It has only been tested on Linux so far.
    
    But by fitting the VSIZE by a pol1 under ROOT, you'll see right away
    by how much your program is leaking.
