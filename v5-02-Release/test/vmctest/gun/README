How to run gun test with both G3 and G4
=======================================

1. event generation

cd $ALICE_ROOT/test/vmctest/gun
./rungen.sh
   --> will generate primary events in an external file

2. simulation & reconstruction

./runtest.sh
   --> will run simulation & reconstruction with both G3 and G4;
       if you want to re-process with one MC only, you can just
       edit the lines with
       RUNG3=1
       RUNG4=1
       
       The output files are moved in g3, g4 directories.
       When repeating test with a different configuration,
       you shoul rename the existing output directory 

3. extract digits

cd g3
../../scripts/digits.sh
cd ../g4
../../scripts/digits.sh

4. plot digits

First select directories to be processed in ../scripts/plotDigits.C
by modifying lines
  label[0] = "g3";    
  label[1] = "g4";
  label[2] = "g4";

cd $ALICE_ROOT/test/vmctest/gun
aliroot ../scripts/plotDigits.C
