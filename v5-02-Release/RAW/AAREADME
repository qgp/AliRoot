Build alimdc using one of the following targets:

depend           # generate dependencies

rdm              # for local running uses /tmp/mdc1 and /tmp/mdc2
                 # and rfio:/castor/cern.ch/user/r/rdm

<default>        # for running in ADC environment but started by hand (not via
                 # SMI). Uses /pool/mdc and /tmp/mdc and 
                 # rfio:/castor/cern.ch/alice/mdc4

smi              # idem as above but for running under control of SMI/DIM.

evb              # access eventbuilder via shared memory segment

debug            # enable debug outout


typical use:

make rdm          # for local testing
make rdm debug    # idem with some debug output
make evb smi      # for running in data challenge under control of DATE
