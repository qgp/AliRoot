Presently (Oct.2007) embedding is possible only with (S)Digits, and not with 
raw data. Therefore, to embed simulated event into real data one has to
1. Reconstruct raw events (example macros RecRaw.C). Of course one should do 
   it in separate dir to avoid mixing files galice.root. 
2. Simulate iMC events (produce simulated digits and merge them with raw ones) 
   (examples macros Config.C and Sim.C)
3. Reconstruct simulated events (example macro Rec.C)
