# This directory contains reviewed analysis examples that can be used as templates
# for a user analysis task. They are intended to demonstrate the usage of the 
# framework in all run modes and for different use cases. The code is not compiled
# in a library but rather compiled runtime as any new analysis task is typically
# developed.
#
# NOTE FOR USERS: When getting inspired from these tasks to develop your own code, 
# please take the time to personalize the content like: class names, includes, data
# members, #define, ... and not just copy-paste the examples.

# NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS: When adding a new example please have in mind that this code
# will be a source for may users to get inspired. Please make sure that:
# - it runs in all modes (local, proof, grid)
# - it is free of bugs and/or leaks
# - code and specific actions are explained in detail
 
 EXAMPLES
==========
Ex01: Simple task demonstrating the usage of ESD track cuts to make inclusive
pt and eta distributions for events selected via the offline physics selection.
 = Usage: root only
   .L runEx01.C
   run(<parameters>); // to select run mode, grid plugin mode, MC usage, dataset,...
 = Please check the sources which include useful comments.
 = To run in local mode, one should download locally data files and organize them in a 
 = directory structure as used by files.txt. Alternatively one can change files.txt
 = to reflect its own local data.
