This is a short documentation of the pendolino and experiences 
gained during the commissioning session April 2010

Pendolino consists currently of a package of nested scripts and macros

The pendolino operates on the system HCDB for the hlt-operator and on the
local operator HCDB ($HOME/HCDB) for all others.

The RunManager starts the PendolinoManager which also is shown as a process
in the TMGUI. The PendolinoManager uses the commands from the configuration
file to start the pendolino.

RunManager-PendolinoWrapper.sh
 | -> ./initGRPEntries.sh
 |      -> setGRPVal.C
 |          - create the initial GRP object and set beam and runtype
 | -> StartPendolino.sh
       |- source environment
       |- clean HCDB
       |- release T-HCDB
       |a) -> PrepareHCDB.sh  (hlt-operator)
       |       - set links for all files in the T-HCDB
       |b) -> setHCDB.C (al other operators)
       |       - copy all objects valid for specified run to operator HCDB
       |- release HCDB
       |- send notification 'hcdb_prepared' to RunManager
       |- merge lists (1 to 3)
       |-> PendolinoDriver.sh (1 to 3 instances: fast, normal, slow)
            -> runPendolino.C
            - stays in a loop

All scripts are installed on the HLT cluster under
/opt/HLT/interfaces/pendolino
The pendolino is compiled with the specific AliRoot version. This is not longer
necessary, all pendolino libraries have been moved to AliRoot

Problems during the commissioning April 2010:
- bug: runPendolino.C  
	if (mainUser.CompareTo(getenv("USER") != 0)) {
- StartPendolino.sh: Pendolino_test was still true
- StartPendolino.sh: environment .setbash.sh was moved to different place
- pendolino - RunManager communication: TM_Notifier could not communicate with RunManager
  because of wrong host settings in dcs0/1
