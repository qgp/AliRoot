How to run one iteration of the pi0 calibration in the GRID:
============================================================

Step 1 (aliensh)

- copy the whole content of this directory (don't forget .roorc!) to your alien directory;
- put pi0Select.sh to your ~/bin alien directory;
- submit jobs from alien shell: submit Pi0Select.jdl
  This will launch the analysis of ~2*10**6 pp min bias events from the 
minbias_LHC09a4_81040_81050.xml collection. To analyze your own collection, update Pi0Select.jdl
and AnaPi0Select.C accordingly.


Step 2 (local directory)

- Copy PHOS.tgz in this directory to your local directory;
- Run 	tar xzf PHOS.tgz

	WARNING: Run this after the _first_ iteration only!!

- merge the outputs of the analysis jobs (files histos.root) to the file Sum_All_Emc.root
 (use macro addhistoEmc.C if needed) and copy this file to your local directory;
- Run pi0Calib.C script to calculate the corrections to the calibration coefficients:
	root -b -q pi0Calib.C
- directory PHOS/Calib/EmcGainPedestals/ will contain the corrections to the calibration 
coefficients to run the next iteration;
- Run   tar czf PHOS.tgz PHOS   and copy PHOS.tgz to your alien directory.

		For next iteration go to Step 1.

Useful files:
=============

- use anaTask.C to run analysis locally. The list of ESD files to analyze is: list.txt.
- for algorithm description and feasibility studies look at the presentation:
