This dir contains compilable macros for selecting bad modules
using ESD. This is done in 2 steps:
1. Make scan of ESD data using macro scanESD.C. It produces 
   set of spectra of (all) clusters with centers in different channels.
2. Analyze produced spectra with macro makeBadModESD.C. It produces
   bad map in the form of TH2S and CDB entry (locally).
