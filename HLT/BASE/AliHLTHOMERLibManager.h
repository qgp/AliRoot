/**
 * @class AliHLTHOMERLibManager
 * Dynamic manager of HOMER library.
 * The class allows to generate objects of HOMER readers and writers
 * dynamically and loads also the HOMER lib. In order to write HOMER library
 * independent code it is important to use the AliHLTMonitoringWriter/
 * AliHLTMonitoringReader classes when ever class methods are used. Those
 * classes just define a virtual interface. <br>
 *
 * Instead of creating a reader or writer by \em new and deleting it with
 * \em delete, one has to use the Open and Delete methods of this class.
 *
 * <pre>
 * AliHLTHOMERLibManager manager;
 *
 * // open a HOMER reader listening at port 23000 of the localhost
 * AliHLTMonitoringReader* pReader=manager.OpenReader(localhost, 23000);
 *
 * // read next event, timeout 5s
 * while (pReader && pReader->ReadNextEvent(5000000)==0) {
 *   unsigned long count=pReader->GetBlockCnt();
 *   gSystem->Sleep(5);
 *   ...
 * }
 *
 * // delete reader
 * manager.DeleteReader(pReader);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The manager does not not provide methods to create a HOMER reader on
 * basis of shared memory. This is most likely a depricated functionality,
 * although kept for the sake of completeness.
