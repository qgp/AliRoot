# Note: Source files definitions must be made in libAliHLTTrigger.pkg

# library definition
# The lib_LTLIBRARIES variable is a fixed variable of the autotools build
# system. All libraries defined by the Makefile template have to be added
# here. Since we aim for separated directories for different libraries
# there will be only one library.
lib_LTLIBRARIES			=  libAliHLTTrigger.la

# version info for the library
# The libtool program is used to created the library, a version number can
# be specified by using the -version-info flag. This flag accepts an argument
# of the form current[:revision[:age]].
# If either revision or age are omitted, they default to 0. Also note that
# age must be less than or equal to the current interface number. Here are a
# set of rules to help you update your library version information:
#
#   1. Start with version information of 0:0:0 for each libtool library.
#   2. Update the version information only immediately before a public release
#      of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only
#      guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.
#   3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
#      then increment revision (c:r:a becomes c:r+1:a).
#   4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
#      update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
#   5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
#      increment age.
#   6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then
#      set age to 0.
